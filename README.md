# Quoridor Game Project

This repository contains the implementation of the Quoridor board game, designed as a project for the Fall 2023 course. The game can be played by 2 to 4 players, with the objective of reaching the opposite side of the board while strategically placing walls to hinder the opponent.

## Game Overview

Quoridor is a strategic board game where each player controls a pawn and a set number of walls. The goal is to move your pawn to the opposite side of the board before your opponent does. Players can either move their pawn or place a wall to block the opponent's path.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Map Creation

- Implement the game board using ASCII characters.
- Input includes board dimensions, player positions, and wall details.


### Phase 2: Gameplay

- Implement the mechanics for a two-player game.
- Players alternate turns, choosing to move their pawn or place a wall.
- Ensure that walls do not completely block a player from reaching their goal.


## Getting Started
